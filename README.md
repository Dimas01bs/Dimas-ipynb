# 📘 Rock Paper Scissors Classification

This project is a **deep learning image classification model** that recognizes **Rock, Paper, and Scissors** hand gestures from images.  
It is built using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** with **TensorFlow/Keras**, trained on the [Rock Paper Scissors dataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/rock_paper_scissors).

The purpose of this project is to create a simple yet powerful computer vision system that can be applied in interactive games, gesture recognition, or as a fun AI demo project. ✨
